			<p><b> Hello. My name is Corinne Brammer I am a sophomore and an OSEH major for occupational safety and environmental health. When I graduate, I would like to work as a safety professional. I am originally from Massachusetts but live in Blue Bell PA and would love to find work close by. Only as of recently did I figure out that I wanted to pursue a career as a safety professional. Originally, I thought I wanted a job that works with kids as I work as a camp counselor over the summer. Dealing with little kid injuries all the time lead me to realize I could do more by preventing injury.<br><br>This website is a portfolio that showcases a variety of my work produced for my class AENG 110. The classes full name is communication & information systems, we have learned about different types of printing systems and more.</p></b></td>
